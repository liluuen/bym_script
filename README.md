Script to delete and edit your posts and threads

Background:

After having been a member in a vBulletin forum for many years and posts ranging in the 30k range the admins decided to shut it down. They wanted to "freeze" it and take away user access to profiles. 

Lots of old members didn't feel comfortable with the thought of their often 15 year old posts still being public yet having no access to delete or change them anymore so they wanted to delete them before the big freeze. However, this was practically impossible since you could only delete them manually which would have taken days or weeks to do and the admins refused to do it themselves. 

So I wrote this script to lighten the burden and automate the process, happy end.
